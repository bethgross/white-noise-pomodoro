# Pomodoro timer with white noise

I like working with pomodoro timers and I like working with white noise. So here's both. 

This is a simple timer that plays white noise for 25 minutes then "dings" at the end.

Sometimes I time my breaks, so included a 5 minute timer for that (no white noise). 

Sometimes I won't want white noise, so I included an on/off toggle.
